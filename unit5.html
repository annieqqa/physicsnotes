            </ul>
            <h2>Application of radioactive substances</h2>
            <h3 style="margin-left: 20px;">The isotope 32P is injected into a person and collects in the tumour.
                Radiation is
                detected outside the person’s body. 32P is a positron emitter with a half-life of almost fifteen days.
                <strong>Explain</strong> why 32P is suitable for this procedure (4)</h3>
            <p class="text" style="margin-left: 20px;">📚 Oct 2022</p>
            <ul style="margin-left: 20px;">
                <li>Positrons annihilate with electrons to produce gamma radiation</li>
                <li>Gamma radiation can penetrate the body</li>
                <li>Half life is long enough to allow the procedure to be performed</li>
                <li>Half life is short enough to avoid unnecessarily large radiation dose</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Cloud chamber, bubble chamber tracks</h2>
            <h3 style="margin-left: 20px;">A student makes the following observations: the alpha particle tracks are
                thick and
                straight; the beta particle tracks are thin and twisted. <strong>Explain</strong> these observations (4)
            </h3>
            <p class="text" style="margin-left: 20px;">📚 Jun 2023</p>
            <ul style="margin-left: 20px;">
                <li>The thickness of the track related to the ionising ability of the particle (not its mass)</li>
                <li>Alpha is strongly ionising and beta is only moderately ionising (so alpha tracks are thick and beta
                    tracks are
                    thin) [Allow a comparison of ionising power of alpha with that of beta]</li>
                <li>The shape of the track related to the mass of the particle (not its ionising ability)</li>
                <li>Alpha particles are massive particles and beta particles are not massive particles (so alpha tracks
                    are straight
                    and beta tracks are twisted) [Allow a comparison of alpha mass with beta mass]</li>

            <h2>Binding energy per nucleus vs stability</h2>
            <h3 style="margin-left: 20px;">The binding energy per nucleon of helium is relatively large.
                <strong>Explain</strong>
                why this makes the helium nucleus particularly stable (2)</h3>
            <p class="text" style="margin-left: 20px;">📚 Jan 2024</p>
            <ul style="margin-left: 20px;">
                <li>The binding energy per nucleon is the energy required to remove a nucleon from the nucleus</li>
                <li>Large energy is required to break the helium nucleus apart</li>
                <li>Decay products (of helium) have a lower binding energy per nucleon</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Conservation of momentum</h2>
            <h3 style="margin-left: 20px;"><strong>Explain</strong> why not all of the energy from the decay is released

                energy of the alpha particle (2)</h3>
            <p class="text" style="margin-left: 20px;">📚 Jun 2022</p>
            <ul style="margin-left: 20px;">
                <li>Momentum must be conserved (in the decay)</li>
                <li>The lead nucleus must recoil after the decay Or the lead nucleus moves in the opposite direction to
                    the alpha
                    particle</li>
            </ul>
            <h3 style="margin-left: 20px;"><strong>Explain</strong> why the emission of an antineutrino in the decay
                leads to a
                range of energies for the beta- particles (2)</h3>
            <p class="text" style="margin-left: 20px;">📚 Oct 2022</p>
            <ul style="margin-left: 20px;">
                <li>Momentum is conserved (so the Ba nucleus recoils)</li>
                <li>Energy released is shared (randomly) between the β− and ν̅ Or the energy is shared between the 3
                    particles in
                    the decay</li>
            </ul>
            <h3 style="margin-left: 20px;"><strong>Explain</strong> why the alpha particle must have an energy greater
                than the
                minimum energy for the reaction to take place (2)</h3>
            <p class="text" style="margin-left: 20px;">📚 Oct 2023</p>
            <ul style="margin-left: 20px;">
                <li>Momentum (and energy) is conserved</li>
                <li>(So) products must have \(E_{\text{k}}\) / momentum after the reaction (as the alpha particle has
                    momentum
                    before the reaction)</li>
            </ul>
            <h3 style="margin-left: 20px;"><strong>Explain</strong> why the kinetic energy given to the alpha particle
                is just less
                than 5.9 MeV (4)</h3>
            <p class="text" style="margin-left: 20px;">📚 Jan 2022</p>
            <ul style="margin-left: 20px;">
                <li>Use of 1 u = 934 MeV (ecf from (b) [Accept calculation from first principles]</li>
                <li>The mass of the Fr nucleus is much greater than the mass of the α</li>
                <li>Momentum is conserved so (recoil) velocity of Fr nucleus is much less than the velocity of the α
                </li>
                <li>So the kinetic energy of the α is much greater than the kinetic energy of the Fr Or (after the
                    decay) the α has
                    most of the kinetic energy</li>
            </ul>
            <h3 style="margin-left: 20px;"><strong>Suggest</strong> why the majority of the energy released is shared
                between the
                beta particle and the antineurino (1)</h3>
            <p class="text" style="margin-left: 20px;">📚 Oct 2021</p>
            <ul style="margin-left: 20px;">
                <li>The mass of the Ni nucleus is much larger than total mass of the other two particles</li>
            </ul>
            <h3 style="margin-left: 20px;"><strong>Explain</strong> why there is a range of energies for the beta
                particles emitted
                in the decay of a sample of potassium-40 (2)</h3>
            <p class="text" style="margin-left: 20px;">📚 Jan 2021</p>
            <ul style="margin-left: 20px;">
                <li>Momentum/KE is given to 3 particles in the decay Or (KE of Ca is negligible so) KE for the
                    beta-neutrino pair
                    was constant</li>
                <li>The energy split between the beta particle and the neutrino is random Or the momentum of the emitted
                    beta
                    particle varies Or The (anti) neutrino energy varies</li>
            </ul>

                <li>A large nucleus splits (into two nuclei plus neutrons)</li>
                <li>The binding energy increases, (so energy is released) [Accept binding energy per nucleon increases]
                    Or There is
                    a decrease in (total) mass, (so energy is released)</li>
            </ul>
            <h3 style="margin-left: 20px;"><strong>Explain</strong> why energy is released when hydrogen nuclei fuse to
                form helium

            <p class="text" style="margin-left: 20px;">📚 Jun 2023</p>

                <li>In the fusion process mass decreases</li>
                <li>So energy is released according to \(∆E = c^{2}∆m\) Or energy is released to conserve mass-energy Or
                    binding
                    energy per nucleon increases</li>
            </ul>

            </ul>
            <h3 style="margin-left: 20px;"><strong>Explain</strong> which type of radiation is emitted from the source.
                You should
                refer to the penetration of each type of radiation through each sheet of absorber (4)</h3>
            <p class="text" style="margin-left: 20px;">📚 Jan 2024</p>
            <ul style="margin-left: 20px;">

                <li>No change in count rate when paper placed (between source and GM tube), so there can’t be any alpha
                    radiation
                </li>
                <li>There can’t be any gamma radiation, as gamma radiation would pass through the aluminium sheet Or
                    There can’t be
                    any gamma radiation, as count rate decreases to background with aluminium sheet.</li>

            </ul>
            <h3 style="margin-left: 20px;">*Ultraviolet radiation is produced when alpha particles interact with air.
                This can be
                used to detect alpha particles when a nuclear reactor is decommissioned.
                <strong>Explain</strong> how UV is produced by alpha particles in the air, and why detecting UV has
                advantages
                compared with detecting alpha particles directly (6)</h3>

                <li>IC4 α radiation is strongly ionising and so has a short range (in air)</li>
                <li>IC5 Ultraviolet radiation is weakly ionising (and has long range in air)</li>
                <li>IC6 UV-radiation can be detected much further from the source so is safer</li>
